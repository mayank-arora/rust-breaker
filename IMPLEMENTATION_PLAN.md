# Interactive Procrastination Guide - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Build a React-based web application that transforms the 30-day procrastination guide into an interactive tool with 5 core features:
1. Interactive 30-day tracker
2. Daily checklist system  
3. Emergency kit interface
4. Learning trap detector
5. Progress journal

## Technology Stack
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Local Storage for data persistence
- CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Structure

### Step 1.1: Initialize Project Structure
**Objective**: Set up the basic React project with proper folder structure
**Verification**: Run `npm run dev` and see the app running at localhost:5173

**Test Cases**:
- **Success**:
  - The command `npm run dev` starts the server without errors.
  - Navigating to `http://localhost:5173` in the browser shows the default React application page.
  - The page title is "Vite + React".
- **Failure**:
  - The `npm run dev` command fails with an error message.
  - The browser shows a "This site can't be reached" error.

**Tasks**:
1. Create the following folder structure:
   ```
   src/
   ├── components/
   │   ├── tracker/
   │   ├── checklist/
   │   ├── emergency-kit/
   │   ├── learning-trap/
   │   ├── journal/
   │   └── common/
   ├── hooks/
   ├── types/
   ├── utils/
   ├── data/
   └── styles/
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom
   ```

3. Create basic routing in `App.tsx` with placeholder components for each feature

### Step 1.2: Define Core Types
**Objective**: Create TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
**Verification**: TypeScript compilation passes without errors. (Note: This is verified via the build process, not browser interaction).

**Tasks**:
1. Create `src/types/index.ts` with interfaces:
   ```typescript
   interface DayProgress {
     date: string;
     week: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;
     completed: boolean;
     minutesCoded: number;
     githubPushed: boolean;
     publicPosted: boolean;
     notes: string;
   }

   interface ChecklistItem {
     id: string;
     text: string;
     completed: boolean;
     week: number;
     category: 'daily' | 'weekly';
   }

   interface JournalEntry {
     id: string;
     date: string;
     learned: string;
     implemented: string;
     avoided: string;
     mood: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
   }

   interface LearningTrapScore {
     total: number;
     categories: {
       tutorials: number;
       research: number;
       planning: number;
       implementation: number;
     };
     risk: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
   }
   ```

## Phase 2: Interactive 30-Day Tracker

### Step 2.1: Create Tracker Component
**Objective**: Build a visual 30-day progress tracker
**Verification**: Shows 30 squares, current day highlighted, progress visually represented

**Test Cases**:
- **Success**:
  - The tracker page displays a grid of 30 squares.
  - Each square is numbered from 1 to 30.
  - One square is highlighted (e.g., yellow border) to indicate the current day.
  - Clicking a past or current day square turns it green (completed).
  - Clicking a completed square turns it back to its original color.
  - Hovering over a square shows a tooltip with details like "Day 5".
  - After marking a day as complete and refreshing the browser, the square remains green.
- **Failure**:
  - The grid does not contain exactly 30 squares.
  - The current day is not highlighted.
  - Clicking a square has no effect.
  - The completion status is lost after a page refresh.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `src/components/tracker/Tracker.tsx`:
   - Display 30 squares in a grid (6 rows × 5 columns)
   - Each square represents one day
   - Color coding: gray (future), green (completed), yellow (current), red (missed)
   - Hover effects showing day details

2. Create `src/components/tracker/DaySquare.tsx`:
   - Individual day component
   - Shows day number and completion status
   - Click to mark complete/incomplete
   - Tooltip with day details

3. Create `src/hooks/useTracker.ts`:
   - Manages tracker state in localStorage

  - When the current day is in Week 2 (days 8-14), the display shows "45 minutes of coding" and "Push to GitHub".
  - Simulating a change in the current week correctly updates the requirements displayed.
- **Failure**:
  - The requirements for Week 1 are shown when the current day is in Week 2.
  - The requirements display does not update when the week changes.

**Tasks**:
1. Create `src/data/weekRequirements.ts`:
   ```typescript
